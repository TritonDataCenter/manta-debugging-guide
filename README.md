This repo contains a very early **DRAFT** of a Manta Debugging Guide.

Build note: the "docs" directory of this repository is published as-is via
GitHub pages.  That means the built docs are committed to this repo.  While
generally regrettable, it's useful to be able to publish via GitHub pages, and
without having to commit to a separate branch in order to do so.
